# Knowlege graph

This document represents the company’s **knowledge graph**. It defines who we are as an organization, what we do, and how every part of the company operates. The goal is that anyone with access to this knowledge graph should be able to understand the company end-to-end and confidently perform any task within it.

All organizational context—including processes, roles, decisions, and institutional knowledge—should be captured and maintained within this knowledge graph. It serves as the single source of truth for the company.

The knowledge graph is maintained using **Git**, ensuring version control, transparency, and traceability over time. For the best experience viewing and navigating the knowledge graph, we recommend using **Obsidian**.
