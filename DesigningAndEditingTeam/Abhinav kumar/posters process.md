 ## **Design Process**

1. **Data Collection using Obsidian**  
    All research-related data about Uttarakhand Government schemes was collected, stored, and organized in **Obsidian**. This helped in managing information in a structured and easily accessible manner.
    
2. **AI-Assisted Data Analysis**  
    The organized data from Obsidian was analyzed with the help of **AI tools**. AI supported in understanding complex information, simplifying details, and identifying key points.
    
3. **Content Structuring**  
    After analysis, the information was arranged into clear sections such as scheme name, beneficiaries, benefits, eligibility, and required documents for better clarity.
    
4. **Design Ideation with AI**  
    **Canva AI** was used to generate design ideas. AI assisted in suggesting suitable layouts, visuals, icons, and color combinations for public awareness materials.
    
5. **Design Development**  
    Final designs were created in **Canva**, focusing on:
    
    - Simple and clean layout
        
    - Easy-to-read Hindi content
        
    - Government-friendly and trustworthy colors
        
    - Relevant images and illustrations
        
6. **Final Review and Refinement**  
    The designs were reviewed to improve readability, alignment, spacing, and overall visual quality before final submission.
