| Image names                           | What I liked                                                                                                                               |     |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --- |
| Personal Branding / Tech Aesthetic    | The use of **vibrant purple gradients** and floating software icons (Photoshop, Illustrator) to create an immediate professional identity. |     |
| Travel & Tourism Collage              | The **geometric circular mask** that divides different scenic photos, creating a clean, modern look for information-heavy content.         |     |
| Cinematic Mystery (Sherlock)          | High-contrast **red-on-black color palette**. The "circle" spotlight effect focuses the eye perfectly on the central figure.               |     |
| Illustrated Montage (Black Panther)   | Complex **character layering** and "vector style" illustration. It uses a restricted color palette (Gold/Blue/Black) to maintain harmony.  |     |
| Halftone / Grunge (Batman)            | The use of **halftone dots** (comic book style) and heavy texture. It feels gritty and tactile rather than a smooth digital render.        |     |
| Surrealism / Double Exposure (Joker)  | The **Polaroid overlay** technique. It uses a "photo within a photo" to show two sides of a character's personality simultaneously.        |     |
| Comic Panel Layout (Miles Morales)    | **Dynamic action lines** and fragmented panels. The "torn paper" effect adds a street-art, energetic vibe.                                 |     |
| Noir Illustration (The Matrix)        | A strict **monochrome (B&W) palette** with sharp, angular divisions. It captures a "graphic novel" aesthetic perfectly.                    |     |
| Commercial / Product Poster (Porsche) | **Typography Interplay**—where the car is layered both behind and in front of the text, creating a 3D depth effect.                        |     |
| Minimalist Silhouette (OG)            | The **long shadow** cast onto the typography. It uses the text itself as a physical environment for the character.                         |     |
