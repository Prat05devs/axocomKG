Verdict: All three accused (**Pulkit Arya, Saurabh Bhaskar, Ankit Gupta**) found guilty.

Sentence: Life imprisonment under IPC Sections 302, 354, and 201.

**Key Issues & Controversies**

==Allegations of VIP involvement in coercion (though not proven in court).


Political fallout: BJP expelled Vinod Arya and his son Ankit Arya (Pulkit’s brother).

Public anger: Resort was demolished amid protests, highlighting failures in women’s safety.

**Allegations in 2025**

Recent viral videos and claims by actress Urmila Sanawar (linked to ex-BJP MLA Suresh Rathore) have accused BJP national general secretary and Rajya Sabha MP **Dushyant Kumar Gautam** (nicknamed "Gattu") of being the VIP who allegedly demanded "special services" from Ankita, with purported audio clips and references to other BJP leaders. 

**Police and official response

- Uttarakhand Police, including Haridwar, registered FIRs against Urmila Sanawar for spreading misleading/edited content to incite mischief and formed an SIT to probe her claims and related materials as of late December 2025. ​
    
- Dushyant Gautam denied the allegations as defamation, demanded removal of the videos, and called for a probe into Sanawar's motives.​
    
- Congress demanded his arrest and CBI inquiry, while BJP leadership sought reports on the political fallout; no arrests or charges against Gautam or others have been reported as of early January 2026.

**Common public claims

- **VIP cover-up**: Many allege the "VIP guest" (possibly Dushyant Gautam per recent videos) demanding "special services" was protected due to BJP ties, with police hiding identities and evidence like CCTV footage or the accused's phone.
- **Political interference**: Accusations that BJP leaders (like ex-minister Vinod Arya, Pulkit's father) pressured police for a hasty probe, resort demolition to destroy evidence, and biased SIT investigation favoring the powerful.​
- **Insufficient punishment**: Ankita's family and protestors say life imprisonment lets killers "live comfortably" and demand hanging, especially if VIPs are involved
- **Witness threats and arrests**: Claims of intimidation against journalists (e.g., Ashutosh Negi arrested) and key witnesses, plus conspiracy by "criminal elements" to derail justice.​
