## Introduction

-   In 2017, the Uttarakhand government initiated a scheme for the state farmers and Self Help Groups (SHG) involved in agriculture activities.
-   The scheme is named as "Deendayal Upadhyay Cooperative Farmers Welfare Scheme".
-   According to the scheme, the state government will provide interest free loans to these farmers and SHGs.
-   Beneficiaries can use this loan for agriculture related activities or as notified in the scheme.
-   The primary objective of the scheme is to double the income of farmers, thereby boosting their livelihoods and strengthening their economic conditions.
-   The implementation of the scheme will also help to create the self employment opportunities in the state.
-   Along with this, it will also aid in reverse migration for youth and others who have migrated from the state in search of employment.
-   Under the scheme, farmers engaged in farming activities can claim a loan of Rs one lakh.
-   Whereas, those involved in non-agricultural activities may avail loans of Rs 3 lakh.
-   Non-agricultural activities include Animal husbandry, Dairy, Poultry, Fisheries, spice, mushroom, flower production, agricultural mechanization, organic farming, poly house, off-season vegetables etc.
-   Additionally, state Self Help Groups involved in agriculture activities may avail a loan of up to Rs 5 lakhs.
-   General, small, and marginal areas farmers are eligible to benefit from the Deendayal Upadhyay Cooperative Farmers Welfare Scheme.
-   However, only one member of each family can avail of the scheme benefit.
-   Small Farmers are those who possess five acres of non-irrigated land and 2.5 acres of irrigated land.
-   While, marginal farmers are those who have 2.5 acres of non-irrigated land and 1.25 acres of irrigated land.
-   To get the benefit of the scheme, beneficiaries must be members of the cooperative department or hold a savings bank account in the cooperative department bank.
-   For successful implementation, the government allocated a budget for this scheme every year.
-   For the year 2024-25 the government has allotted 85 crore rupees.
-   It is to be understood that the benefits for a financial year can be availed of until the allocated budget limit is exhausted.
-   Once the loan is granted, the farmers must insure their crop under the [Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana](https://www.govtschemes.in/pradhan-mantri-fasal-bima-yojana-pmfby).
-   Beneficiaries may apply for the scheme through the district cooperative bank or via the department committee.
-   Beneficiaries must repay their loan within the given period of time.
-   If anyone fails to repay their loan within the allotted time they will not receive the benefit of the scheme, and interest will be charged as applicable.
-   If any farmer applies for the scheme but didn't receive the loan, their application will be eligible for the next year, and they will not need to apply again.
