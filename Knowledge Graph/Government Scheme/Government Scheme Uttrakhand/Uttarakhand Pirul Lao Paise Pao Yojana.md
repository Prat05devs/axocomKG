## Introduction

-   Major fires have broken out in the forest of Uttarakhand Kuman and in Garhwal division, becoming one of the most common headlines especially during May-June.
-   Unfortunately, it has become a routine for the locals, who dealt with this problem on the ground.
-   There are a number of devastating fire incidents that were reported by the Uttarakhand government every year but…
-   The efforts made by the government to curb these fires are insufficient.
-   As a result, this year around 1300 acres of forest land have been affected by forest fires.
-   Usually, forest fires are caused by the dry pine leaves.
-   These pine foliage, also called 'pirul' in local language, are highly flammable.
-   Excessive heat or even a slight spark can ignite these leaves, and in no time this fire escalates and spreads rapidly throughout the forests.
-   Such fires cause huge damage not only to the environment but also to the property, flora, fauna and other.
-   The pine trees, which cover almost every part of Uttarakhand, were planted by the British government during their reign.
-   As per the report, these pine trees produce 1.8 million tons of pirul across the state every year.
-   However, to prevent such fires the government has also taken some steps to manage this foliage.
-   Recently, pirul has been used as a raw material to operate a 25 kw power plant installed in Uttarkashi.
-   For this, the government purchases pirul from the individuals at Rs. 3/kg.
-   However, this price is not enough to incentivize people to take the risk and collect pirul from the forest.
-   Therefore, the government has decided to launch a new initiative called the 'Pirul Lao-Paise Pao' mission.
-   Under this mission, the government has decided to purchase pirul @ 50 Rs per kg.
-   On 18 July 2024, the government has prepared a proposal for the scheme and will be implemented in due course.
-   Upon its implementation, people can submit these pirul at the collection center installed by the government.
-   The scheme is open for all, so anyone can collect these foliage and take the benefit of the mission.
-   At these collection centers, staff will collect the pirul and weigh it.
-   The amount of benefit, as per the weight of collected pirul, will be credited directly into the bank account of individuals.
-   The collected pirul will then be transported to industries that use such pirul as a raw material.
-   Not many but yes there are some benefits of such pine foliage.
-   It can be used for making beds for animals, mixing with cow dung, it can be used as a fertilizer, and also utilized for packaging.
-   For the success of Pirul Lao-Paise Pao mission , the government outlayed a corpus of Rs 50 crore.
-   For its successful implementation, Pollution Control Board of Uttarakhand adjudged its nodal agency.
