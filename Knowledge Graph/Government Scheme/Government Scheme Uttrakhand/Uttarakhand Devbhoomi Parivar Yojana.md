## Scheme Introduction: A Brief Overview

-   Several states in India already use family-based identification systems to deliver welfare schemes to the right households.
-   Uttar Pradesh runs the [Family ID – Ek Parivar Ek Pahchan](https://www.govtschemes.in/family-id-ek-parivar-ek-pahchan-yojana) programme, Haryana uses the [Parivar Pehchan Patra (PPP)](https://www.govtschemes.in/haryana-parivar-pehchan-patra-yojana), Rajasthan issues the [Jan Aadhaar Card](https://www.govtschemes.in/rajasthan-jan-aadhar-scheme), and Madhya Pradesh connects families to schemes through the Samagra ID.
-   These integrated databases help governments verify genuine beneficiaries and make the entire welfare delivery process more transparent.
-   Following the same model, the Uttarakhand Government is preparing to roll out the Devbhoomi Parivar Yojana.
-   The aim is to create a complete and accurate record of all families by assigning each household a Unique Family ID.
-   This ID will store key details of every family member and help the state link them to schemes like the [Mahalakshmi Kit Scheme](https://www.govtschemes.in/uttarakhand-chief-minister-mahalakshmi-kit-scheme), [Old Age Pension Scheme](https://www.govtschemes.in/uttarakhand-old-age-pension-scheme), [Devbhoomi Udyamita Yojana](https://www.govtschemes.in/uttarakhand-devbhoomi-udhyamita-yojana), and several others.
-   Through the Devbhoomi Parivar Yojana, the state intends to ensure that :-
-   Welfare benefits reach the actual resident families.
-   Fraudulent claims reduce significantly.
-   Duplicate IDs are removed.
-   The state's core demographic and cultural identity stays protected.
-   By issuing a Unique Family Identification ID, Uttarakhand promises better transparency, faster verification, and a smoother connection between families and government programmes.
-   The Devbhoomi Parivar Yojana marks a major step toward clean data, fair scheme distribution, and a more efficient governance system in the state.
-   The Cabinet approved the scheme on 13 November 2025.
-   The government will now start building the official portal in the coming days.
-   We will update this page as soon as any new information becomes available.
