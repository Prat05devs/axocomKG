**Safety Interventions: District Heatmaps and Responsive Policing**

A disaggregated crime heatmap (district × ward × age group × offense type) will identify hotspot geographies and vulnerable demographics, enabling targeted deployment of women police officers, mobile safety squads, and rapid-response teams. For example, if data reveal that 45% of harassment occurs in specific transport corridors during 6–8 PM, light-rail or bus route redesigns with enhanced lighting and CCTV are justified. Similarly, if certain districts show high reporting rates but low conviction rates, training and resource allocation to investigating officers becomes evidence-based.

The Ankita Bhandari case underscores demand for accountability mechanisms. A data bank documenting FIR progression (FIR filed → charge sheet filed → conviction) by district and agency reveals systemic delays and bottlenecks. Fast-track courts for sexual violence cases, specialized training for police on trauma-informed investigation, and victim support centers become evidence-supported policy asks.

**Financial Inclusion: Identifying the "Credit-Ready" Segment**

Current data show that SHG microfinance achieves high satisfaction (80%) but reaches only 5% of rural women. A data bank can identify the "credit-ready" segment: women with secondary+ education, stable livelihood, and demonstrated savings behavior who lack only formal credit access. Targeted subsidized credit lines, skill-to-enterprise conversion programs, and guaranteed buyback arrangements for ODOP products can be prioritized by district.

The education-income correlation (₹12,000 for higher education vs. ₹2,000 for no schooling) suggests that skill training and vocational certification yield the highest ROI per rupee invested. Data-driven budgeting can shift resources from generic SHG formation (many defunct) to high-impact, targeted interventions.

**summary

**Sampling Strategy:**

- Sample size: **8,000–12,000 women**

- Stratified across 13 districts, oversampling hill/remote GPs.

- Age bands: 18–24, 25–34, 35–49, 50–64, 65+

- Categories: caste/tribe, rural/urban/hill/plain.

**Core Indicator Sets:**

1. **Demographics:** Age, education, caste, migration, residence.

2. **Safety & Mobility:** Harassment types, night travel, toilet access, safety apps.

3. **Economic:** Occupation, income, assets, social security.

4. **Financial Inclusion:** Bank account, credit, insurance, SHG status.

5. **Health & Sanitation:** Maternal health, toilet type, menstrual access.

6. **Political & Civic:** Voter history, PRI membership, scheme awareness.

7. **Digital:** Phone ownership, internet, digital literacy.

**Data Integration Architecture:**

- Administrative sources (police, health, electoral rolls)

- Survey data (NFHS-5, NSS)

- Crime stats (NCRB)

- Geospatial data (Census blocks, GP shapefiles)
