**Health, Sanitation, and Mobility**

Uttarakhand performs relatively well on health indicators, ranking 11th nationally on the health and nutrition subindex of the Women Empowerment Index (11.2 out of 17). Maternal mortality (188 per lakh live births) is lower than many states, though still above targets. However, gaps persist in sanitation and mobility. Public toilet access remains inadequate in rural areas, particularly hill districts where geographic isolation increases implementation costs. A pilot in Uttarakhand demonstrated that women equipped with skills to build toilets in their own communities dramatically reduced open defecation and improved safety during menstruation and vulnerable periods. 

Public transport is a critical safety and economic access issue. Women constitute 84% of public transport riders in Indian cities and rely heavily on buses for work commutes and household access. Dehradun's recent initiative to deploy 14 female bus drivers signals growing recognition of this need. However, infrastructure gaps—overcrowding, inadequate street lighting, limited last-mile connectivity—continue to constrain women's mobility, particularly in evening and night hours.
