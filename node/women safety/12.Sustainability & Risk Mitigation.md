**Critical Success Factors and Risk Mitigation**

**Data Quality and Ethical Safeguards**

- **Risk:** Survey fatigue, social desirability bias, underreporting of violence due to shame or fear
- **Mitigation:** Female enumerators only, privacy-assured interviews (no household members present during sensitive questions), psychosocial training for enumerators to handle disclosures, anonymous survey option, integration with survivor support services (referrals to shelters, counseling).

**Political Acceptability and Neutrality**

- **Risk:** Allegations that data bank is politically weaponized by government or opposition
- **Mitigation:** Independent research institution as custodian (university or registered NGO), transparent methodology published in peer review, multi-stakeholder advisory board (government, opposition parties, civil society, academia), commitment to release all findings publicly and simultaneously to all stakeholders.

**Sustainability Beyond 2027**

- **Risk:** Data bank becomes stale, loses relevance, defunded after elections
- **Mitigation:** Integrate into state statistical infrastructure (e.g., link to state planning department or statistical office), train state staff to conduct periodic updates, establish data-sharing agreements with electoral commission for ongoing integration, embed in university curriculum (student researchers can contribute).

**Privacy and Data Protection**

- **Risk:** Personally identifiable information (PII) leakage, linkage attacks (combining data bank with voter rolls to identify individuals)
- **Mitigation:** Strict anonymization protocols (remove names, address, phone), secure encryption (AES-256), access controls (authorization logs), data retention limits (delete after analysis), compliance with state privacy policies and IT Act.

**Risks & Mitigation:**

1. **Data Quality:** Female enumerators, privacy assurance, psychosocial training.

2. **Political Bias:** Independent custodian (university/NGO), transparent methodology.

3. **Sustainability:** Integrate into state statistical office, periodic updates.

4. **Privacy:** Anonymization, encryption (AES-256), access controls, data retention limits.
