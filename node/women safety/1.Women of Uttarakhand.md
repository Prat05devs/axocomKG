**Women of Uttarakhand: A Data Bank & Policy Atlas for the 2027 Elections**

**Executive Summary**

This report provides a detailed feasibility and implementation blueprint for "Women of Uttarakhand: A Data Bank & Policy Atlas," an evidence-driven initiative to map women's political and economic power across Uttarakhand's 13 districts ahead of the 2027 Assembly elections. Grounded in analysis of existing datasets, policy frameworks, and demographic realities, the project is both technically feasible and politically urgent.

**Key Finding:** Uttarakhand presents a paradox—women voters (67.2% turnout in 2022) significantly outnumber men (62.6%), yet only 9% of elected representatives are women. This gap reveals an untapped political opportunity. Simultaneously, crime rates against women have surged 48% in two years (52 to 77 per lakh women), safety concerns dominate public discourse following the Ankita Bhandari case, and economic participation remains constrained by financial exclusion (40% of rural women cite financial barriers). A granular, geocoded data bank will convert this fragmented reality into actionable intelligence for policymakers, political strategists, and civil society.

**Current State Assessment**

**Demographic Baseline**

Uttarakhand's female population stands at approximately 4.95 million across 1.25 crore residents. However, critical gender imbalances exist. The state's overall sex ratio of 963 females per 1,000 males masks sharp regional variation: hill districts maintain a healthy ratio of 1,064 females per 1,000 males, while plains (905) exhibit significant female deficit, particularly in urban areas (Dehradun: 902, Haridwar: 880). The child sex ratio of 890 indicates persistent gender bias affecting the youngest cohorts. 

**Educational attainment diverges by gender.** Only 31% of women have completed 12+ years of schooling compared with 34% of men. Rural female literacy (76.31%) lags urban (84.45%), though Uttarakhand performs better than the national average. This education-income correlation is stark: women with no formal education earn ₹2,000 monthly, while those with higher education earn ₹12,000—a six-fold differential with statistically significant correlation (r=0.967, p=0.0186).
