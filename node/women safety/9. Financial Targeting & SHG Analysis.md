**Financial Inclusion: Identifying the "Credit-Ready" Segment**

Current data show that SHG microfinance achieves high satisfaction (80%) but reaches only 5% of rural women. A data bank can identify the "credit-ready" segment: women with secondary+ education, stable livelihood, and demonstrated savings behavior who lack only formal credit access. Targeted subsidized credit lines, skill-to-enterprise conversion programs, and guaranteed buyback arrangements for ODOP products can be prioritized by district.


The education-income correlation (₹12,000 for higher education vs. ₹2,000 for no schooling) suggests that skill training and vocational certification yield the highest ROI per rupee invested. Data-driven budgeting can shift resources from generic SHG formation (many defunct) to high-impact, targeted interventions.
