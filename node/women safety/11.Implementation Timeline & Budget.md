**Implementation Timeline and Budget Implications**

**Phase 1: Preparation & Institutional Setup (Weeks 1–8)**

- Principal investigator and data science lead recruitment
- Partnership formalization with state departments, universities, and field agencies

- Descriptive statistics, cohort analysis, regression modeling
- **Estimated cost:** ₹20–30 lakh (data scientists, GIS specialists, software licenses)

**Phase 4: Deliverable Production and Dissemination (Weeks 20–28)**

- Interactive dashboard development (district/age filters, downloadable charts)
- Policy brief authoring (3–5 briefs for state government, parties, civil society)
- Research report with methodology annex and recommendations
- Media-ready one-pagers by district for campaign use
