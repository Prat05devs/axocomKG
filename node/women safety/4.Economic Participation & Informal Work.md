**Economic Participation: High Activity, Low Formalization**

Sixty-two percent of rural women are engaged in agriculture, yet most lack secure land tenure, credit access, or social security coverage. Female labor force participation stands close to the national average, but women predominantly work as self-employed or informal wage laborers in agriculture, animal husbandry, small enterprises, and tourism sectors. Only 5% of rural women participate in Self-Help Groups (SHGs), indicating severe financial exclusion.


The microfinance ecosystem, Uttarakhand's primary vehicle for women's economic empowerment, shows mixed results. Only 24% of SHGs remain active after eight years; 62.3% are discontinued. However, active SHGs demonstrate high impact: 80% of beneficiaries report satisfaction with microfinance programs, and NRLM (National Rural Livelihood Mission) interventions achieve 75% satisfaction. When properly designed, SHGs enhance women's decision-making power, increase asset ownership, and boost participation in political and social activities.
