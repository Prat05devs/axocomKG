**Safety Crisis: Beyond the Headlines**

Recent data confirms that Uttarakhand faces a genuine women's safety crisis. Dehradun ranks among the top 10 least safe cities for women nationally per the National Commission for Women's NARI 2025 report. Half (50%) of women experience harassment in public transport; 19% report neighborhood harassment; 13% face workplace assault. Troublingly, 40% of harassed women take no action, citing lack of trust in law enforcement, fear of retaliation, or tragic normalization.

Crime statistics corroborate this perception. Uttarakhand's crime rate against women increased 48% between 2020 and 2022 (from 52 to 77 cases per lakh women population), tracking the national trend of rising violence. Rape cases doubled year-over-year in 2024 (23 reported cases vs. ~10 previously). Total crimes against women reached 4,337 cases in 2022. The recent Ankita Bhandari murder case—a 19-year-old receptionist killed at a luxury resort in Pauri Garhwal—catalyzed public outrage and amplified demands for systemic accountability. These incidents are not aberrations; they reveal structural gaps in police responsiveness, investigative capacity, and victim support infrastructure.

The policy response has been incremental. Uttarakhand Police report deploying women patrol teams, checkpoints with female officers, and promoted use of the Gaura Shakti safety app (1.25 lakh registrations as of early 2025). However, the perception-reality gap is telling: while police cite tech adoption, only 4% of women report using digital safety tools, suggesting low awareness or distrust of available mechanisms.
