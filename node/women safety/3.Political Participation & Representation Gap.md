**Political Participation: High Turnout, Low Representation**-Women voters have become a decisive electoral force. In the 2022 Uttarakhand Assembly elections, women outvoted men by 4.6 percentage points (67.2% female turnout vs. 62.6% male turnout). This 20% increase in female voter participation over the past two decades (2004–2019) represents a fundamental shift in electoral dynamics. In hill districts specifically, female voters surpassed males substantially—28,202 women per Assembly seat vs. 23,086 men.


Yet this voting power has not translated into representation. Only 8 women were elected to the 70-seat Assembly in 2022 (11.4%), and only 1 represents Dehradun district. Female participation in local governance remains restricted at approximately 12%, despite constitutional mandates for women's reservation in Panchayati Raj Institutions. This representation deficit is a political vulnerability for incumbent parties and an opportunity for strategic challenger messaging.
