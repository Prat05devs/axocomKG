**Data Bank Design Framework**

**Sampling and Disaggregation Strategy**

The proposed data bank should employ stratified sampling across all 13 districts, with oversampling in hill and remote gram panchayats (GPs). A recommended sample size of 8,000–12,000 women across age bands (18–24, 25–34, 35–49, 50–64, 65+), caste/tribe categories, and rural/urban/hill/plain typologies would enable robust district-level and age-cohort analysis. This aligns with precedents: the NFHS-5 surveyed 76,683 women across 9,104 communities in 720 districts, and the Digital Gender Atlas integrated U-DISE, Census, and DLHS data into comparable geographic layers. 

Primary fieldwork should be conducted by locally recruited, gender-sensitive enumerators with fluency in regional languages (Garhwali, Kumaoni, Hindi). Field teams should be segregated by geography (hill vs. plain) to account for distinct livelihood systems, mobility patterns, and social norms. Informed consent, data anonymization, and secure storage (encrypted servers, minimal PII collection) are non-negotiable for ethical compliance and privacy protection.

**Core Indicator Sets**

**Demographics:** Age band, education level (no schooling → postgraduate), caste/tribe (SC, ST, OBC, General), household size, migration history, current residence (district, gram panchayat, ward), urban/rural/hill/plain designation.

**Safety & Mobility:** Experience of harassment/assault (by type: street, transport, workplace, home), frequency of night travel, access to and usage of public toilets, perceived safety in public spaces and transport, distance to nearest police station, awareness of and utilization of safety apps (Gaura Shakti, SOS tools).

**Economic:** Primary occupation, employment type (wage, self-employed, unpaid family labor), sector (agriculture, tourism, services, manufacturing, informal), monthly income, asset ownership (land, house, livestock, durables), access to social security schemes (PM-KISAN, e-Shram, pension).

**Financial Inclusion:** Bank account ownership, KYC status, credit access (source, amount, interest rate, repayment status), insurance coverage (health, life, crop, micro-insurance), digital payment adoption, SHG membership (active/inactive).

**Health & Sanitation:** Maternal health service access (ANC, institutional delivery, postnatal care), distance to nearest health facility, toilet type (private/shared/open defecation), menstrual hygiene product access, immunization status.

**Political & Civic:** Voter registration, election turnout history (local/state/national, 2019–2022), membership in SHGs, PRIs, or local bodies, frequency of contact with elected representatives, awareness of government schemes (PMJDY, PM-KISAN, Bhamashah Card, Saarthi).

**Digital:** Mobile phone ownership and type (basic/smartphone), internet access, social media usage, digital literacy level (none/basic/intermediate/advanced), awareness of and use of safety apps.

**Contextual:** Presence of local women's support centers, helplines, police camps, hospital proximity, dominant livelihood activities in GP, prevalence of migration in village.

**Data Integration Architecture**

The data bank should synthesize:

1.    **Administrative sources:** State departments (Women & Child Development, Rural Development, Police, Health), electoral rolls (gender-disaggregated voter rolls, constituency-level turnout data), SHG registers from DRDAs, NRLM beneficiary lists.

2.    **Survey data:** NFHS-5 (health, demographic, financial inclusion indicators), NSS (employment, income), CMIE-like datasets, state-specific employment surveys.

3.    **Crime statistics:** NCRB FIR data by district and offense category (rape, dowry death, trafficking, acid attack, assault), case progression (FIR → charge sheet → conviction).

4.    **Geospatial data:** Census enumeration block (CEB) boundaries, gram panchayat shapefiles, service facility locations (health centers, police stations, banks, anganwadis, post offices), village-level development indices.

A harmonized relational schema (SQL database) should enable queries such as: "Which age-district combinations show highest crime rates and lowest bank account penetration?" or "Which gram panchayats have both high female outmigration and low SHG membership?" This enables pattern identification and causal inference.

**summary

**Sampling Strategy:**

- Sample size: **8,000–12,000 women**

- Stratified across 13 districts, oversampling hill/remote GPs.

- Age bands: 18–24, 25–34, 35–49, 50–64, 65+

- Categories: caste/tribe, rural/urban/hill/plain.

**Core Indicator Sets:**

1. **Demographics:** Age, education, caste, migration, residence.

2. **Safety & Mobility:** Harassment types, night travel, toilet access, safety apps.

3. **Economic:** Occupation, income, assets, social security.

4. **Financial Inclusion:** Bank account, credit, insurance, SHG status.

5. **Health & Sanitation:** Maternal health, toilet type, menstrual access.

6. **Political & Civic:** Voter history, PRI membership, scheme awareness.

7. **Digital:** Phone ownership, internet, digital literacy.

**Data Integration Architecture:**

- Administrative sources (police, health, electoral rolls)

- Survey data (NFHS-5, NSS)

- Crime stats (NCRB)

- Geospatial data (Census blocks, GP shapefiles)
