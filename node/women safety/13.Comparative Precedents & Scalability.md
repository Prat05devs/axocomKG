**Comparative Precedents and Scalability**

This project is not novel; similar women's data banks and gender atlases have succeeded in other Indian states and globally:

- **Digital Gender Atlas (Education):** MHRD's 2015 web-based platform mapped girls' education across 720 districts using U-DISE, Census, and DLHS data. It identified low-performing geographic pockets and vulnerable groups (SCs, STs, minorities) and enabled visual assessment of intervention effectiveness. A women's economic empowerment atlas can follow this blueprint.
- **Women Empowerment Index (NFHS-5):** Researchers synthesized NFHS-5 data across 28 states into a four-dimensional empowerment index (economic, decision-making, health, gender roles). Uttarakhand scored 23.46/39, revealing specific weaknesses (economic empowerment: 3.3/9) amenable to targeted policy. Scaling this to district and age-cohort levels would deepen actionability. 

- **Election Commission Gender Disaggregation:** India's 2022 election cycle produced gender-disaggregated voter turnout data by district and phase. Further integration with socioeconomic data enables voter profiling and messaging optimization. 

- **World Bank Gender Data Portal:** This global resource aggregates gender statistics from 190 countries, enabling benchmarking and peer learning. India's women's data bank can contribute nationally comparable data and identify best practices (e.g., how did Tamil Nadu or Kerala achieve higher women's representation and financial inclusion?). 

Scaling to other states (Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand's peer hill state; or Rajasthan, a large state with gender challenges) would require adaptation to local context but follows a proven methodological pathway.

**Existing Models:**

- **Digital Gender Atlas (MHRD 2015):** Mapped girls’ education across 720 districts.

- **NFHS-5 Women Empowerment Index:** Uttarakhand scored 23.46/39.

- **Election Commission Gender Data:** 2022 gender-disaggregated turnout.

- **World Bank Gender Data Portal:** 190-country benchmarking.

**Scalability:** Adaptable to Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, etc.
