**Financial Inclusion: Access Gaps and Opportunity**

Women's access to banking, credit, and insurance remains constrained. Only 21% of Uttarakhand households are headed by women, but female-headed households often lack collateral and business experience to access formal credit. The strong education-income correlation demonstrates that skill development and financial literacy are direct pathways to economic independence. Yet training uptake is uneven: while programs like ODOP (One District One Product) have trained 57–58% women beneficiaries in some districts, women's access to credit to launch enterprises remains stuck at 25%, reflecting a critical "training-to-credit conversion gap".
