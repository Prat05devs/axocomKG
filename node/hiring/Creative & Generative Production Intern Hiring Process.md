## On-site Interview Rounds

### Round 1: Portfolio & Screening

Focus areas:

- Ownership: Individual contribution vs team work
- Honesty: Detect exaggeration or borrowed work

Evaluation Criteria:

- Problem-solving during creation
- Authenticity of work

Goal:  
To judge whether the candidate has actually conceptualized and produced the work they claim.

### Round 2: Creative & Generative Production Task

Give two task options:

1. Conceptual / Abstract

- Example:  
    “Create a visual or narrative concept that represents the idea of ‘Human–AI Coexistence’.”

3. Practical / Applied

- Example:  
    “Design a short video or visual campaign concept for launching X brand/product.”


#### Deliverables (choose based on medium):

- Creative brief (1 page)
- Asset mockups / storyboard / script / rough cut
- Tool stack used
- Rationale behind creative choices

#### Scoring Criteria:

- Originality of idea
- Translation of concept → execution
- Aesthetic sense & coherence
- Use of tools (including generative tools, if applicable)
- Practical feasibility
- Attention to detail


### Round 3: Group Discussion / Creative Jam

Format:

- Give a random creative prompt (e.g., “Reimagining News for Gen Z”)
- Let the group ideate, discuss, and converge

What we look for:

- Ability to listen and build on others’ ideas
- Reaching a common creative direction
- Unique insights and lateral thinking
- Respectful disagreement
- Avoid rewarding only loud or dominant speakers


### Round 4: HR Round

This round focuses on the person behind the creator.

Discussion Points:

- What are they genuinely passionate about?
- Hobbies, side projects, or personal creative pursuits
- What kind of content can they work on endlessly?
- Availability of a laptop / personal tools
- Ability to hold independent, rational opinions
- Openness to feedback and critique

Also:

- Ask for candidate feedback on the process
    
- Observe how thoughtfully they reflect and respond
    

  

## Important Considerations

- Always use the company’s official email address for recruitment communication:  
    recruiter@axocom.in
- All records and documentation should be maintained under: [[Creative & Generative Production Internship Sheet]]

## Risks & Future Improvements

- Creative bias based on personal taste
- Over-indexing on aesthetics over thinking and intent 
- Penalizing introverted but highly capable creators
- Talent drop-off due to a long or intensive process
