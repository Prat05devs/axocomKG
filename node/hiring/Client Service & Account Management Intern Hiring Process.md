### Focus Areas

- Walkthrough of:
	- Previous internships
	- Sales, marketing, or client-handling experience

	- A deal or opportunity that didn’t work out

### Evaluation Criteria

- Ability to articulate experiences clearly
- Ownership vs passive participation
- Logical thinking and decision-making

## Round 2: Client Strategy & Sales Task

### Task Structure (Choose One)

#### Option A: Strategic / Client Understanding Task

Example Prompt:  
“You are assigned a mid-sized media company as a client. They want to improve engagement and revenue using Axocom’s services. How would you approach this?”

	- “A client is unhappy with delivery timelines — how do you handle it?”
	- “How would you sell a premium service to a cost-sensitive client?”

### What We Look For

- Listening and empathy

## Risks & Future Improvements
