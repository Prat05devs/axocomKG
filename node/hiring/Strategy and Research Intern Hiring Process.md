# Process

1. Reach out to TAs of colleges and send a job posting in internshala. For this you need to create a JD (job description). Example [[Internship Job description]]

2. Take a phone screening round with the person. This is mostly done to know what their expectations are. This will also screen out prank applications and students who have forgotten they have applied

3. Send an on-site round interview round email to all the students who are interested. [[Axocom onsite round mail For Strategy and Research Analyst Intern]]

4. Ask them to come early in the morning to judge punctuality
5. Ask them to come with their CV printed.

  

## On site Interview

Round 1. Screening

Talk about what he has written on his CV. 

- Clarity of explanations
- Depth vs surface knowledge
- Ownership of projects
- Honesty (detect exaggeration)

We want to judge if he has actually done those things. Ask about himself and cross question him to judge him


Round 2: Research and Strategy Task

Give 2 topic options:

- One abstract (e.g., “Future of AI regulation”) 
- One practical (e.g., “Market entry strategy for X”)

Define clear deliverables:

- 2–3 page report
- Executive summary (200 words)
- References section (mandatory)

Score on:

1. Structure & clarity
2. Quality of sources (blogs vs reports/books)
3. Original insights (not copied synthesis)
4. Logical flow
5. Referencing discipline


Round 3: Group discuss

Give a random topic to the group and see how the discuss went

1. We want to look for people who are able to come to a common ground or able to understand everyone
2. We want to look for people who come up with unique insights showing that they have critical thinking

Avoid rewarding only “loud speakers”.

  

Round 4: HR Round

  

This is about them

1. Try to find out what they are really passionate about. What are their hobbies and what is something they can always work on? We want to see how we can take that part of them and can utilize it for ourself
2. See if they have a laptop or not
3. See their political alignment and if they can have independent thoughts. We want to judge if they can think and have a rational mind
4. Ask them for their feedback. See what they can come up with

2. All the things are maintained in [[Strategy and Research Analyst Internship Sheet]]
