### **Motive:**

Ankita was pressured to provide "extra services" (sexual favors) to a VIP guest arriving on September 19. When she refused, resort owner Pulkit Arya, along with manager Saurabh Bhaskar and staff Ankit Gupta, murdered her.
### **Background (September 1-17, 2022)**

- Ankita Bhandari, born November 11, 2003, from Pauri Garhwal, Uttarakhand

- Excellent student (88% in 12th grade) but forced to drop hotel management course due to ₹40000 fee shortage

- Friend Pushpadeep helped her get job at Vanantara Resort through OLX advertisement

- **First night (September 1):** Harassed by a guest; complained to Pulkit Arya

- **September 9-10:** Room shifted near Pulkit's room under pretext of "more guests"

- **September 10 night:** Pulkit, Saurabh, and Ankit drank alcohol in Ankita's room; Pulkit harassed her

- Ankita decided to quit but was persuaded to stay with false apologies

### **The VIP Incident (September 17-18)**

- **September 17:** Ankit Gupta pressured Ankita to provide "extra services" for VIP guest arriving September 19

- Ankita refused, saying: "I'm poor, does that mean I'll sell myself for ₹10,000?"

- She immediately informed friend Pushpadeep and former employee Vivek Arya

- **September 18 morning:** Pulkit threatened Ankita with job termination if she didn't handle the VIP guest

- Her room was shifted again to Pulkit's room area

- **4:30 PM:** Argument escalated about VIP services

- **5:30 PM:** Ankita packed bags to leave, called staff Saurabh Bisht for help

- Multiple staff witnessed her distress calls for help

### **The Murder (September 18 evening)**

- **6:00 PM:** Ankita called electrician Ayush crying: "Take me away from here"

- **7:57 PM:** Ankita's last call to Pushpadeep: "Pulkit covered my mouth, snatched my bag, misbehaved with me"

- **8:00 PM:** Pulkit, Saurabh Bhaskar, and Ankit Gupta took Ankita on scooter and motorcycle

- **8:30 PM:** Captured on CCTV heading toward Chilla canal

- **8:32 PM:** Ankita's last call to Pushpadeep: "I'm trapped between them, they can do anything"

- **9:00 PM:** Group stopped at Chilla barrage checkpoint by forest guard Ashish Purohit

- **9:38 PM:** Pulkit called Pushpadeep pretending Ankita needed another job

- **Between 9:00-10:00 PM:** Ankita murdered at Chilla canal, body thrown in water

### **Cover-up Attempt (September 18 night - 19)**

- Accused returned to resort around 10 PM

- Ankit Gupta pretended to take food to Ankita's room to create alibi

- All phones switched off

- **September 19 morning:** Pulkit reported Ankita "missing" to revenue police

- Created false narrative of Ankita being "depressed"

### **Investigation & Delays (September 19-22)**

- Ankita's father Virender Singh faced bureaucratic runaround:

  - Pauri police station → Muni Ki Reti → Rishikesh Kotwali → Laxman Jhula

  - Finally directed to revenue police (patwari chowki)

- **Shocking revelation:** Pulkit had already filed complaint with revenue police

- Revenue Sub-Inspector Vibhav Pratap went on leave without transferring case

- Patwari Vivek Kumar made family wait 2.5 hours while meeting with accused

- Police initially refused to file FIR based on father's complaint

### **Breakthrough & Arrests (September 22-24)**

- **September 22:** Case transferred to regular police after public pressure

- Police investigated resort staff statements

- **September 22-23:** All three accused arrested based on:

  1. CCTV footage of them leaving with Ankita

  2. Staff eyewitness accounts

  3. Ankita's last chats and calls

  4. Contradictions in accused statements

- **September 23:** BJP MLA Renu Bisht bulldozed resort, destroying crime scene

- **September 24:** Body recovered from Chilla barrage after stopping water flow

### **Postmortem & Evidence**

- **Cause of death:** Drowning due to asphyxia (alive when thrown in water)

- **Injuries:** All ante-mortem (before death), not from falling

- **Sexual assault:** Neither confirmed nor ruled out

- **Stomach contents:** Half-digested food eaten in Rishikesh city 1 hour before death

### **Trial & Conviction (2022-2025)**

- **Accused defense:** Claimed Ankita committed suicide due to depression

- Alleged she fabricated VIP story to pressure Pushpadeep into marriage

- **Evidence against defense:**

  1. Multiple staff witnesses

  2. CCTV evidence

  3. Last distress calls

  4. Pre-meditated destruction of CCTV system

- **May 30, 2025:** Additional Sessions Judge Reena Negi convicted all three

- **Sentence:** Life imprisonment (not death penalty as family wanted)

## **KEY EVIDENCE & FINDINGS**

### **Digital Evidence**

1. **WhatsApp chats:** Ankita's messages about VIP "extra services" demand

2. **Call records:** Last calls to Pushpadeep and Ayush

3. **CCTV footage:** Group leaving resort, seen at Rishikesh AIIMS area

### **Physical Evidence**

## **CURRENT STATUS**

- All three convicts serving life imprisonment

- Family dissatisfied with sentence (wanted death penalty)

- VIP identity remains unknown

- No action against police officials who delayed investigation

- No investigation into evidence destruction by MLA

**Justice delivered but incomplete** - While perpetrators are punished, systemic issues and unanswered questions remain, highlighting the struggle of poor victims against politically connected offenders in India's justice system.
