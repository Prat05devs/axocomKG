We are a media branding and advertising company. Our work is organized around three core departments that together deliver everything we do.

Although team members are encouraged to contribute across disciplines, final responsibility and decision-making rest with the individual officially assigned to a task. Every project or piece of work is categorized under one of the three core departments:

### 1. Research and Analysis

The Research and Analysis team is responsible for gathering data, conducting research, and transforming existing information into meaningful insights. Their primary role is to build and maintain the company’s data layer—providing the factual and analytical foundation upon which strategy and creativity are developed.

### 2. Account Management and Client Services

The Account Management and Client Services team works closely with clients and serves as the public face of the company. They manage client relationships, handle social media accounts, and ensure smooth communication between the client and internal teams. They also build relationships with local journalists and media outlets to help pitch and place stories.

### 3. Strategy and Creative

The Strategy and Creative team is responsible for developing concepts and executing creative work. This includes crafting strategies, producing and editing videos, generating images, and bringing ideas to life through design and storytelling.


### Collaboration and Idea Generation

Ideas can originate from anyone in the organization, regardless of department. However, collaboration across all three departments is essential to turn an idea into a successful outcome.

- A researcher may generate an idea based on data, trends, or insights.
- A creative may develop an idea through artistic exploration or experimentation.
- An account manager may propose an idea based on direct conversations with clients and a deep understanding of their needs.
    

While these perspectives ultimately aim toward the same goal, it is rarely feasible for a single individual to fully perform all roles at the highest level. This is why collaboration is critical.


### Processes and Documentation

We are a document first company everything that we do its done over a document which will become part of our knowlege graph. Over time, we will refine how each task is performed and establish structured processes to ensure consistency, efficiency, and quality across all projects.
